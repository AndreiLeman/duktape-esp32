<div class="note">
Symbol values are visible in the C API as strings, e.g. <code>duk_is_string()</code>
is true (this behavior is similar to Duktape 1.x internal strings).  Symbols are
still an experimental feature.  For now, you can distinguish Symbols from ordinary
strings by looking at their initial byte, see
<a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/blob/master/doc/symbols.rst">symbols.rst</a>.
