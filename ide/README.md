#ESP32-Duktape IDE
This Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a platform where a developer can build JavaScript
applications with a browser based editor that is JavaScript language aware.  From there, he can deploy that code
on ESP32-Duktape and run it.  The console output from the execution will also be shown within the browser.

This is a very early release and much more work still needs to be done to make it as functional as desired.
